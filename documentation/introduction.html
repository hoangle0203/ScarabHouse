                                <p>
                                    Blockchain term is not very unfamiliar to the world these days. 
                                    Although blockchain tech was introduced in 1991 and first used in 2009 to transact in the cryptocurrency bitcoin, 
                                    it's still been demonstrating its versatility in a wide range of real-life aspects, such as supply chain management, 
                                    digital identification, healthcare system, etc. As its name is so pronounced, 
                                    every transaction is wrapped in a decentralized block which is then chained with other blocks to keep the data flow making its most useful advantage - sharing data in security. 
                                    Thus, there have been more business choosing it as the main type of transaction, and because blockchain tech is cryptography-based, 
                                    there are more apps and software created to help those business transact by cryptocurrency. Game industry is not an exception, 
                                    it has a very successful history in the entertainment aspect with traditional type of transaction. 
                                    Not stop at that point, with the use of blockchain tech, game companies tend to enhance the security of user's data, 
                                    giving more choice of transaction with a kind of "universal" currency - cryptocurrency. 
                                    ScaraboGhoul game has applied blockchain tech in crypto-based transactions and sharing data, giving more choice for gamers, 
                                    and helping contribute the expansion of game industry in this new direction.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The name of ScaraboGhoul game is made up of two parts - <strong>Scarab</strong> and <strong>Ghoul</strong>. 
                                    This game has been inspired by <strong>loveliness and irrefutable contribution of dung beetle in keeping our environment clean and green</strong>. 
                                    Scarab is a large dung beetle of the eastern Mediterranean area, being generally called for about 35000 species in the Scarabaeidae family. 
                                    Scarab was also regarded as a sacred symbol in ancient Egypt which makes its name sound more archaic and occult. 
                                    And Ghoul was known as a legendary evil being that robs graves and feeds on corpses which, however, 
                                    gives the audience the creeps at the first moment. When coming together, 
                                    Scarab and Ghoul would like to create a new creature that sounds more friendly and more responsible in the role of environment cleaner, 
                                    and to compensate for its contribution, treasures found in processed tombs that become pristine will be a worthwhile reward.
                                </p>

                                    users should redeem Scarab eggs, feeding them with some kinds of dung, and hatching them to the maturity form. 
                                    Scarab eggs and mature Scarab characters can be traded directly in game or on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/scaraboghoul" target="_blank">OpenSea</a> website via Polygon blockchain. 
                                    <strong>Ghoul stage</strong> which will be developed and given out a debut in the near future, users will take the adventures to ancient tombs around the world, 
                                    if they can pass a certain point of each scene, they can get some rare treasures which then can be minted to be NFTs for their own.
